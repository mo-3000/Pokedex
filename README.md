**Pokedex iOS Application**  
This README outlines the implementation details and the architectural
choices made in the development of the Pokedex iOS application. The
application fetches data about Pokémon from the PokeAPI and displays
these details in a user-friendly manner.  
**Overview**  
The application is structured around the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
architecture to separate the presentation logic from the business logic,
enhancing testability and maintainability. This structure also
facilitates a clear division of responsibilities among different parts
of the application.  
**Implementation Details**  
Models  
The application defines several models to handle the data from the
PokeAPI:

- **Pokemon**: Represents basic information about a Pokémon, including
  its name and details URL.

- **PokemonList**: A container for a list of Pokemon objects,
  corresponding to the API's pagination mechanism.

- **PokemonDetail**: Contains detailed information about a Pokémon,
  including stats, types, abilities, and an image URL.  
  These models are designed to be decodable from JSON data directly,
  aligning with Swift's Codable protocol for straightforward data
  parsing.  
  **View Models**

<!-- -->

- PokemonListViewModel: Manages the list of Pokémon, handling data
  fetching and state management for the UI. It fetches both summary
  lists and detailed Pokémon data as needed.

- **PokemonDetailViewModel**: Manages the data for an individual
  Pokémon's detailed view.  
  These view models use dependency injection for services like data
  fetching (APIService) and image loading (ImageLoader), enhancing
  modularity and ease of testing.  
  **Views**

<!-- -->

- PokemonCell: A custom table view cell that displays information about
  a Pokémon. It is responsible for configuring its view elements based
  on the data provided by the view model.

- **TableHeaderView**: Displays a static header at the top of the
  Pokémon list.  
  **Controllers**

<!-- -->

- PokemonListViewController: Manages the display of the Pokémon list. It
  uses a UITableViewDiffableDataSource for modern, efficient data
  rendering in the table view.

- **PokemonDetailViewController**: Displays detailed information about a
  specific Pokémon, retrieved from the PokemonDetailViewModel.  
  **Networking**

<!-- -->

- APIService: Implements the APIServiceProtocol, providing the
  mechanisms to fetch data from the PokeAPI. It handles all network
  requests, utilizing URLSession.

- **ImageLoader**: A singleton service used to fetch and cache images
  asynchronously, improving the performance and user experience of the
  application.  
  **Utilities**

<!-- -->

- Custom Extensions and Helpers: The application may include custom
  extensions for string manipulation, data formatting, or additional
  UIKit enhancements, which are not detailed in this document but are
  structured similarly to the other service components.  
    
  **Architectural Choices**  
  The choice of MVVM was driven by the need for a testable, maintainable
  architecture that separates concerns effectively. Using Codable for
  model definitions simplifies JSON data handling, reducing boilerplate
  and potential parsing errors.  
  The use of dependency injection, particularly in view models, enhances
  testability and decouples the application components. This is evident
  in the separation of data fetching and image loading from the view
  controllers, which focus solely on UI logic.  
  **Testing Strategy**  
  Unit tests are written to cover the view models and networking
  services, ensuring that data handling and business logic are correct.
  Mocks and stubs are used to simulate network responses, allowing
  comprehensive testing without real network requests.
