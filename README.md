# Pokedex iOS Application

## Overview

This README outlines the implementation details and the architectural choices made in the development of the Pokedex iOS application. The application fetches data about Pokémon from the PokeAPI and displays these details in a user-friendly manner.

## Architecture

The application is structured around the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to separate the presentation logic from the business logic, enhancing testability and maintainability. This structure also facilitates a clear division of responsibilities among different parts of the application.

### Models

- **Pokemon**: Represents basic information about a Pokémon, including its name and details URL.
- **PokemonList**: A container for a list of `Pokemon` objects, corresponding to the API's pagination mechanism.
- **PokemonDetail**: Contains detailed information about a Pokémon, including stats, types, abilities, and an image URL.
- **Sprites**, **StatType**, **StatInfo**, and other supportive models are designed to manage specific data aspects efficiently.

### View Models

- **PokemonListViewModel**: Manages the list of Pokémon, handling data fetching and state management for the UI. It fetches both summary lists and detailed Pokémon data as needed.
- **PokemonDetailViewModel**: Manages the data for an individual Pokémon's detailed view.

### Views

- **PokemonCell**: A custom table view cell that displays information about a Pokémon.
- **TableHeaderView**: Displays a static header at the top of the Pokémon list.

### Controllers

- **PokemonListViewController**: Manages the display of the Pokémon list.
- **PokemonDetailViewController**: Displays detailed information about a specific Pokémon.

### Services

- **APIService**: Implements the `APIServiceProtocol`, providing mechanisms to fetch data from the PokeAPI.
- **ImageLoader**: A singleton service used to fetch and cache images asynchronously.

## Implementation Details

### Networking

Networking is handled through `APIService`, which uses `URLSession` for all HTTP requests. Responses are parsed directly into Codable structs to minimize parsing errors and streamline data handling.

### Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is used extensively to decouple components and enhance testability, particularly within view models which require instances of `APIService` and `ImageLoader`.

### Asynchronous Image Loading

`ImageLoader` is designed to improve the user experience by asynchronously loading and caching images, reducing load times and avoiding UI freezes.

### Error Handling

Errors are managed using Swift's native error handling capabilities to ensure that all network-related errors are caught and handled gracefully.

## Testing Strategy

The application includes unit tests that cover critical functionalities, particularly the view models and service components. Mocks are used to simulate network responses, allowing for comprehensive testing without actual network requests.

## Conclusion

This Pokedex application demonstrates a robust implementation using modern iOS development techniques and architectures. The choice of MVVM for the architectural pattern ensures that the UI is decoupled from the business logic, making the app more maintainable and testable.
